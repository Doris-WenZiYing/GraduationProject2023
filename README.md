**<h3 style="text-align: center;">2023 Feng Chia University Undergraduate Computer Science Graduation Project</h3>**

The Textile Anti-Counterfeiting Identification System is an iOS app for verifying textile authenticity. It uses YOLOv5 with CoreML for accurate detection of real or fake trademarks, swiftly confirming product authenticity and helping reduce counterfeit distribution.

## Features

1. **Intuitive UI Design**: Streamlined interface for easy camera scanning and product info retrieval.

2. **Custom-Trained YOLOv5 Model Integration**: Integrates a custom-trained YOLOv5 model into our iOS app for real-time product recognition, utilizing Swift along with CoreML and Vision frameworks for enhanced detection accuracy.

3. **QR Code Capabilities**: Advanced QR code scanning and decoding to guide model selection and enhance anti-counterfeiting measures.

4. **Firebase Authentication**: Robust user login/logout system for data security and privacy.

5. **Informative Product Pages**: Detailed and categorized product information to user preferences for a personalized experience.
